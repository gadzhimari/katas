Given two array write and export by default function which merge two arrays
into one sorted. The simple implementation exists on using nested loop and in
worst case the complexity is - O(n * m). There is an opportunity to implement
this algorithm with complexity of O(n + m). For this case you need pass
the sorted arrays as arguments into the function.

```js
merge([1, 5, 10], [5, 6, 15, 100]) // [1, 5, 5, 6, 10, 15, 100]
```
